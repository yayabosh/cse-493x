Tests for WBE Chapter 2 Exercise `Mouse Wheel`
==============================================

Testing boilerplate:

    >>> import test
    >>> _ = test.socket.patch().start()
    >>> _ = test.ssl.patch().start()
    >>> _ = test.patch_canvas()
    >>> import browser

Note: This test was removed because it was difficult to get it to pass on all 3 major OSes.

To course staff: see git history for a copy of the old test.
